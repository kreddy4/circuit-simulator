# circuit-simulator 

# Goal
- Provide code samples (can be of various implementations) for ECE464 students to start their project. 
- Create your own branch and keep revising it. Feel free to check out other branches but try to keep your implementation unique with your own style.

# Function 
Read from a circuit bench file describing the netlist of various gates, take in (as a file or from user) binary vector(s) to the circuit INPUT wires, simulate the running of the bench circuit, and produce (as a file or on screen) the final values of the circuit OUTPUT wires.

# Priority
1) Readability of Python code - prefer straightforward implementation without complex datastructure / algorithm.
2) Neat output format - aligned position for input / output vectors, consider pprint and / or csv format, etc.
3) Debugging / Intermediate information and other insights - consider output nicely formatted information for debugging usage, such as printout of values of your datastructure, stats of the circuit, values on the internal wires, etc.
